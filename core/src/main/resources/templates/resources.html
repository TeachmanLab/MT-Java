                <p><b><h3 id="item1">Accessing High-Quality Treatment</h3></b></p>
                <p>Please note that when looking for appropriate treatment options, you may want to consider the following:</p>

                <ul><li>Look for a psychological or psychiatric treatment with research studies scientific research supporting its effectiveness.</li>
                <li>Find a treatment provider with whom you feel comfortable. This means it is absolutely within your
                    rights to ask questions before committing to any specific type of treatment, whether it be psychotherapy or medication.</li></ul>

                <p>Remember that everyone struggles with feelings of sadness or worry or not liking how they look, etc.
                It is normal to experience these feelings at times, and having a few symptoms does not mean that you meet
                criteria for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. However, we recommend that you consider seeking a professional
                evaluation if you are experiencing these symptoms more strongly than is typical for you (or for most other people you know),
                for an extended period of time (e.g., extremely sad mood for more than a couple weeks), or if the symptoms start to interfere
                with your ability to live your life in the way you want.</p>
