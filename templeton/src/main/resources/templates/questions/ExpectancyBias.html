                    <p> During this task, you will see a number of paragraphs that describe different situations.
                        Please read each paragraph carefully, and imagine yourself in the situation described. </p>

                    <p> After each paragraph, you will see a set of sentences describing an event that might happen next.
                        Although we know that you can't be sure what would happen next, and there is no right or wrong answers,
                        we would like you to judge the likelihood of each of the events occurring next, given all the information that has already happened in the paragraph. </p>

                    <p> Please rate to what extent each of the sentences presented is likely to come next in the situation using a scale from 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely).
                        Rate each sentence separately, ignoring the other sentences that followed the paragraph; in other words, just think about whether the sentences you are rating would be likely to come next after the paragraph.
                    Please click "continue" to begin. </p>

                    <h3> Doctor's Appointment:</h3>
                    <p>You go into the examination room at your doctor’s office for a routine checkup. </p>

                    <p> Your doctor tells you that she is slightly concerned about a mole on your shoulder and would like to get a biopsy.
                        She also says she is concerned about the increase in your blood pressure since your last visit. </p>

                    <p> When she checks your heartbeat, your doctor tells you that she likes what she hears.
                        She adds that your lipid levels have improved since she last saw you. </p>

                        You find it difficult to join the group’s conversation because it is full of stories you weren't a part of.</p>

                    <h3> Moving Away: </h3>
                    <p>You are preparing to move to a new city for your job, and your friends are helping you pack. </p>

                    <p>You carefully wrap your dishes in bubble wrap before boxing them up. You and your friends take a little break, and you offer everyone some water. </p>

                    <p>When you start packing again, one of your friends mentions that she frequently visits the city you’re moving to for work, and she suggests you guys should get lunch when she is in town.
                     You start thinking about your friends from college who also moved away, and how you have kept in touch despite the distance.</p>
