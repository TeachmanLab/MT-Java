                            <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate a new, experimental anxiety reduction program called
                                Calm Thinking. The program consists of the following parts:</p>
                            <ul style="padding-right: 10px">
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;One initial assessment</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Training sessions 1-5 (with additional assessments following Sessions 3 and 5)</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;One follow-up assessment</li></ul>

                            <p> The program runs over the course of five weeks (one training session per week) with a two-month
                                follow-up assessment. Each of the assessments and training sessions will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.

                            </p>

                            <p><b><h3>What will I be asked to do?</h3></b></p>
                            <p>The <b>assessments</b> consist of a number of questionnaires about your thoughts and mood, your background,
                                and personal mental health history. You will be asked to complete four assessment parts total:
                                prior to session 1, after sessions 3 and 5, and two months following completion of session 5.
                            </p>

                            <p> In the <b>training sessions</b>, you will be presented with one of a few different training programs
                                designed to shift how you think about situations. You may be asked to read information about anxiety
                                problems and their treatment, and answer questions, or read brief stories and complete word fragments,
                                by filling in one or more missing letters in a word. We are testing which program most effectively reduces anxiety.
                            </p>

                            <p> Although our prediction of which training program will be most effective is based on previous work
                                in the laboratory, it is important to compare the effects of each program in the real world
                                before drawing any conclusions. In psychology research, a common way to compare programs is to randomly assign each
                                participant to one of the training versions.</p>

                            <!--<p> If you get randomly assigned to a program that we do not think will be the strongest one, you will have the
                                opportunity to complete the program that we expect to be most effective <i>after</i> you finish the study.
                                In other words, EVERYBODY will eventually get the chance to try the program that we expect will be most effective.
                            </p>

                            <p> Some participants may be asked to work briefly with a support coach via phone, email, and/or texts,
                            to discuss your progress in the study. After an initial call – which would occur shortly after Training
                            Session 1 – your weekly phone contact with the coach will be brief (typically 2-10 minutes). The coach
                            will not be providing therapy, but can address questions, support your work, and help troubleshoot any
                            issues that that come up when interacting with the online training program. </p>-->

                            <p>At the end of the study, you will receive more details about the study’s rationale and design. You will also
                                receive feedback about the progress you made during the program. </p>

                            <p>For some participants, being asked to complete assessments about their thoughts and mood can be temporarily distressing;

                            <p>Data from this study may be submitted to the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA).
                                The NDA is a data repository run by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) that allows
                                researchers studying mental health and substance use to collect and share deidentified information
                                with each other. A data repository is a large database where information from many studies is
                                stored and managed. Deidentified information means that all personal information about research
                                participants such as name, address, and phone number is removed and replaced with a code number.
                                With an easier way to share, researchers hope to learn new and important things about mental
                                illnesses more quickly than before.</p>

                            <p>During and after the study, the researchers will send deidentified information about your health and
                                behavior to NDA. Other researchers nationwide can then file an application with the NIMH to
                                obtain access to your deidentified study data for research purposes. Experts at the NIMH who know
                                how to protect health and science information will look at every request carefully to minimize
                                risks to your privacy.</p>

                            <p>You may not benefit directly from allowing your information to be shared with NDA. The information
                                provided to NDA may help researchers find better treatments. NIMH will also report to Congress and
                                on its web site about the different studies that researchers are conducting using NDA data. However,
                                you will not be contacted directly about the data you contributed to NDA. </p>

                            <p>You may decide now or later that you do not want to share your information using NDA. If so, contact
                                us at <a href="mailto:studyteam@mindtrails.org">studyteam@mindtrails.org</a>, and we will tell NDA,
                                which can stop sharing the research information. Please note that NDA cannot take back information
                                that was shared before you changed your mind. If you would like more information about NDA, this is
