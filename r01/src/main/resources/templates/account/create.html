                            <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate a 5-week experimental anxiety reduction program called MindTrails.
                                The program consists of the following parts:</p>
                            <ul style="padding-right: 10px">
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;An initial set of questionnaires</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;5 weekly training sessions (with a set of questionnaires after sessions 3 and 5)</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;A set of questionnaires 2 months after you finish the training</li></ul>

                            <p>Each of the assessments and training sessions will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.</p>
                            <br></br>

                            <b>Assessments</b>
                            <p>You will be asked to complete questionnaires about your thoughts, mood, background, and personal mental health history.</p>

                            <br></br>
                            <b>Training</b>
                            <p>You will be presented with one of our training programs designed to shift how you think about situations.
                                You may be asked to read brief stories about situations that often produce anxiety and fill in missing letters to complete words or read information about anxiety problems and their treatment.</p>

                            <br></br>
                            <p>If you get randomly assigned to a program that we do not think will be the strongest one, you will have the opportunity to complete the program that we expect to be most effective after you finish the study.
                                In other words, EVERYBODY will eventually get the chance to try the program that we expect will be most effective.
                                In psychology research, a common way to compare programs is to randomly assign each participant to one of the training versions.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the study, you will receive more details about the studyâ€™s rationale and design. You will also receive feedback about the progress you made during the program!</p>

                            <p>For some people, completing the training program may help reduce symptoms of anxiety.
                                However, there may be no direct benefits to you. For some people, being asked to answer questions about their thoughts and mood can be temporarily distressing, but most people experience minimal-to-no distress or do not feel distressed for long.</p>

                            <p>MindTrails uses the same secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) that banks and other commercial
                                websites use to transfer credit card information in an encrypted format. This provides strong security
                                for data transfer to and from our website, though privacy is necessarily limited by the security
                                of the technology that is being used. To view the entire privacy policy in a separate page,
                                please <a th:href="@{/public/privacy}" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

                            <p>Please note that completing the study in a public place where others might view your screen, and use
                                of open networks or free Wi-Fi can increase the chance for loss of privacy.</p>

                            <p><u>Data Sharing</u></p>

                            <p>Following data collection, we plan to share de-identified data from this protocol online. Many funding agencies
                                and journal outlets encourage or require researchers to make data available to other researchers online. This is
                                becoming common practice in research endeavors around the world, and data sharing helps ensure that best practices
                                in data integrity and analysis are being upheld. The publication of data online involves preparing a data file that
                                removes personally identifying data from participantsâ€™ responses before making it available (e.g., by sharing it in a
                                public data repository) so that no one can identify who provided the data. For example, participantsâ€™ names and other
                                personally identifying information would never be shared.</p>

                            <p>Data from this study may be submitted to the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA).
                                The NDA is a data repository run by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) that allows
                                researchers studying mental health and substance use to collect and share deidentified information
                                with each other. A data repository is a large database where information from many studies is
                                stored and managed. Deidentified information means that all personal information about research
                                participants such as name, address, and phone number is removed and replaced with a code number.
                                With an easier way to share, researchers hope to learn new and important things about mental
                                illnesses more quickly than before.</p>

                            <p>During and after the study, the researchers will send deidentified information about your health and
                                behavior to NDA. Other researchers nationwide can then file an application with the NIMH to
                                obtain access to your deidentified study data for research purposes. Experts at the NIMH who know
                                how to protect health and science information will look at every request carefully to minimize
                                risks to your privacy.</p>

                            <p>You may not benefit directly from allowing your information to be shared with NDA. The information
                                provided to NDA may help researchers find better treatments. NIMH will also report to Congress and
                                on its web site about the different studies that researchers are conducting using NDA data. However,
                                you will not be contacted directly about the data you contributed to NDA. </p>

                            <p>You may decide now or later that you do not want to share your information using NDA. If so, contact
                                us at <a href="mailto:studyteam@mindtrails.org">studyteam@mindtrails.org</a>, and we will tell NDA,
                                which can stop sharing the research information. Please note that NDA cannot take back information
                                that was shared before you changed your mind. If you would like more information about NDA, this is
