                <p th:text="#{debriefing.p1a}">We are studying new approaches to reduce anxiety. The approach used in the study is based on models of anxiety, which have shown that
                    anxious people tend to interpret ambiguous situations as threatening. It has been proposed that the tendency to interpret things in a threatening
                    way plays a role in the onset of, and recovery from, anxiety problems. Thus, during training, you were asked to read and imagine yourself in a
                    series of brief stories and the last word (or word fragment) gave almost all of the brief stories a positive meaning. We expect this will encourage
                    a more flexible and less negative thinking style.</p>

                <p th:text="#{debriefing.p1b}">>In the current study, we are evaluating a new version of our program that is specifically designed to meet the needs of individuals experiencing anxiety
                    who identify as Hispanic. We are offering the program in its original English form and also in a new Spanish form, and we are inviting some people to complete
                    the program who describe themselves as fluent in both English and Spanish, and other people who describe themselves as fluent in Spanish but not in English.
                    We are also testing whether different messages inviting people to participate in the program are more or less effective at encouraging people to enroll.
                    For instance, some people received an invitation to participate that emphasized how the program might help relieve physical symptoms of anxiety while other
                    people received an invitation to participate that emphasized how the program might help them enjoy more time with their family.</p>
