                <p><b><h3 th:text="#{privacy.heading1}" id="item1">OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</h3></b></p>

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p1a}">The MindTrails team and The University of Virginia are strongly committed to maintaining the privacy
                    and security of confidential personal information and other highly sensitive data that it collects.
                    Our privacy and public records obligations are governed by applicable Virginia statutes, including,
                    but not limited to, the Virginia Privacy Protection Act of 1976, the Virginia Freedom of Information
                    Act and by any applicable U.S. federal laws.</p>

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p1b}">This study site has implemented stringent protections to safeguard participants’ confidentiality.
                    All communication between project servers and participants’ computers is routed through Secure
                    Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology, the gold standard for protecting data transfer from
                    unauthorized access. This is the same secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS), that banks and
                    other commercial websites use to transfer credit card information in an encrypted format.</p>

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p1c}">Participants’ email addresses or phone numbers will not be shared with third parties.</p>

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p1d}">Any information participants provide on the site will be stored on a secured database.
                    Information collected will be associated with a unique ID and not with the participant’s
                    email address. When data are used for analysis, no personally identifying information will
                    be associated with the data.</p>

                <p><b><h3 th:text="#{privacy.heading2}" id="item2">NOTICE ABOUT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3></b></p>

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p2a}">This notice applies to all information collected by the MindTrails website. The following information
                    explains the Internet privacy policy and practices that MindTrails has adopted, and complies with the
                    broader Privacy Policy for the University of Virginia. This notice should not be construed as a
                    contractual promise, and we reserve the right to amend it at any time without notice.</p>

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p2b}">When you access our web pages, the client information and the essential and nonessential
                    technical information listed below is automatically collected — we refer to those categories
                    collectively as "access information.” No other information is collected through our official
                    website except “optional information” sent to us by email or online forms.</p>

                    <li th:text="#{privacy.p3c}"><b>Nonessential technical information:</b> the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our website and the "cookie information" described below.</li>

                <span th:text="#{privacy.p3e}">Some of the information we collect is highly sensitive in nature. We comply the University of Virginia’s

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p4a}">Client information is used to route the requested Web page to your computer for viewing.
                    In theory, the requested Web page and the routing information could be discerned by other entities
                    nvolved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not control the privacy practices of those
                    entities. Essential and nonessential technical information helps us respond to your request in an
                    appropriate format (or in a personalized manner) and helps us plan website improvements.</p>

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p4b}">We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website. For example,
                    we may report that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website or that Y number
                    of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything
                    that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p4c}">We will keep client information from our systems indefinitely after the webpage is transmitted,
                    but we do not try to obtain any information to link it to the individuals who browse our website.
                    However, on rare occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer security, logs of access
                    information are retained to permit a security investigation and in such cases may be forwarded
                    together with any other relevant information in our possession to law enforcement agencies.</p>

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p4d}">Under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, any records in our possession at the time of a
                    Freedom of Information Request might be subject to being inspected by or disclosed to members of
                    the public for any purpose they may desire. As indicated above, client information may be retained
                    after transmission of the requested webpage and might be available for inspection.</p>

                <p th:text="#{privacy.p4e}">Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways
                    unrelated to the ones described above without clear notice and the opportunity to opt-out or
                    otherwise prohibit such uses.</p>
