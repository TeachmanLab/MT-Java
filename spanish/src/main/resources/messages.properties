# FAQ

faq.shortTitle=FAQ
faq.title=Frequently Asked Questions

faq.heading1=GENERAL QUESTIONS
faq.q1=1. I’ve completed some sessions and am still feeling anxious. Is the program not working for me?
faq.a1=Don’t give up! It can take time to learn how to use what you are learning in the sessions in your own life. It is important to keep completing the sessions and to honestly and accurately report your feelings throughout the program. You are helping us learn what works.
faq.q2=2. What if I miss a session? Can I do two the following week?
faq.a2=Try to complete one session each week. We will send you email reminders to help you remember when you should complete your next session. If you miss a session, complete it as soon as you have time (though we ask you to always leave at least one day between sessions).
faq.q3=3. Where and when can I do the sessions?
faq.a3=You can complete this program wherever and whenever you would like, as long as you have access to an Internet connection (through a smartphone, tablet, or computer). We strongly recommend that you complete the tasks when you are in a reasonably quiet place and able to pay full attention to them.
faq.q4=4. I have limited computer or smartphone skills. Can I still use this program?
faq.a4=Yes. Anyone with access to the Internet and an email address is welcome to use this site. If you can access your email and use an Internet browser, you have the skills needed to complete the study. No special skills are required. You will be asked to either click on your responses or type letters into boxes. Throughout the study, we will send you emails to update you on your progress and to remind you of upcoming tasks. You can also email us if you have any questions: studyteam@mindtrails.org.
faq.q5=5. Who created this program?
faq.a5=Researchers from the University of Virginia created these programs, but they were adapted from computer tasks that have usually been tested in research laboratories (see Hallion & Ruscio, 2011). As clinical scientists, we are interested in studying how well the programs work in the real world. In the long run, we want to create a cost-effective and accessible mental health treatment.
faq.q6=6. Is this really going to work for my anxiety?
faq.a6=This is an experimental program so it is still in the testing phase, but prior research indicates it may be able to reduce feelings of anxiety. Even if you are not assigned to the training task condition, you will be given the opportunity to complete it.
faq.q7=7. I’m already receiving treatment for my anxiety (e.g., taking prescriptions or seeing a therapist). Can I still use this program?
faq.a7=Yes, anyone that qualifies from the questionnaire is welcome to use this program. Before you begin, you will be asked a series of questions about your mental health – please let us know if you are already receiving treatment.
faq.q8=8. What devices can I use to complete the program? Can I switch devices depending on where I am?
faq.a8=This study is available on computer, smartphone, and tablet. Currently supported Internet browsers are: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari. You are welcome to switch between devices over the course of the study (for example, if you start the study on your computer but go on vacation during one of the study weeks, you can do the study from your smartphone). Just make sure to know your login information (including your password).

faq.heading2=SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE PROGRAM
faq.q9=1. When answering questions (following each of the brief stories), the program keeps telling me that my answer is incorrect.
faq.a9=Please answer the questions based on information given to you in the stories. Remember that it is essential that you fully involve yourself as if the events described are really happening to you, so your answers should reflect that.
faq.q10=2. When trying to complete word fragments at the end of the brief stories, the program keeps telling me my answer is incorrect.
faq.a10=Please complete the word fragments based only on information given to you in the brief stories.

# The Science of MindTrails

researchSupport.title=The Science of MindTrails
researchSupport.intro1=The program you’re completing is a type of intervention called
researchSupport.intro2=cognitive bias modification
researchSupport.intro3=(CBM), and it is designed to help you change how you think in response to situations that make you feel anxious or upset.

researchSupport.heading1=What Are Cognitive Biases?
researchSupport.p1=Cognitive biases are tendencies to pay attention to, remember, and interpret things differently when processing information tied to your emotional responses. For example, sometimes it can be difficult to tell whether something that happens is good or bad. Our tendency to interpret these ambiguous events as positive or negative can happen very rapidly and even without our being aware of our interpretation, so it can be difficult to catch these thinking habits — even though a tendency to routinely interpret things in negative ways can make us feel more anxious or sad. That’s where CBM might help.

researchSupport.heading2=Changing Cognitive Biases
researchSupport.p2a=CBM works by giving people
researchSupport.p2b=lots of practice processing information in new ways 
researchSupport.p2c=to help develop healthier thinking habits. These tasks may seem repetitive, and it is not always obvious what the program is doing. However, there is growing evidence that CBM can be an effective method for reducing negative feelings, like anxiety and sadness.
researchSupport.p2d=Several research studies have shown that CBM is effective at changing interpretations in people with clinical levels of anxiety. Further, many studies have found that CBM leads to decreases in anxiety symptoms and/or anxious reactions to potentially stressful situations, compared to control conditions (a condition that may look like the active training but is not expected to work as well).
researchSupport.p2e=Participants are randomly assigned to either the active training or control conditions. At the end of the study, we can test whether the active training condition was more effective in promoting healthier thinking and emotional responses. It is normal to have some concerns about being placed in a control condition. In our study, every participant will have a chance to experience the condition that we expect to be most effective.

researchSupport.heading3=Treatment Components
researchSupport.p3=Studies have shown that repeated training of CBM can be especially beneficial, because it provides more opportunities to practice healthier ways of thinking than a single training session. This is why we set up multiple brief sessions of training. Similarly, studies have found that biases in how you picture things in your mind are closely connected to difficulties with anxiety, which is why the program includes exercises where participants imagine certain scenarios.

researchSupport.heading4=The Need for Research
researchSupport.p4=Although there are many examples of CBM programs helping to reduce anxiety, and even helping other problem areas like depression, substance use (e.g., alcohol abuse), eating disorders, and anger problems (among others), there are also some mixed findings. Not all studies using these approaches get the same results, and some studies find decreases in one anxiety measure but not another. Also, more research needs to be done to find the optimal number of training sessions, and to figure out how to make CBM as effective if completed online as in the clinic or lab. Though there are still open questions, one goal of this site is to work on answering these questions in order to refine and improve this promising treatment method.

researchSupport.heading5=Research Papers on CBM by the MindTrails Team
researchSupport.p5a=Here are some of the main research papers examining CBM by our team (papers marked with

consent.print=Print This Page

consent.heading1=What is the MindTrails Study?
consent.p1a=The purpose of this study is to investigate a 2-week experimental anxiety reduction program called MindTrails. The program consists of the following parts:
consent.p1b=An initial set of questionnaires
consent.p1c=2 weekly training sessions
consent.p1d=A set of questionnaires after you finish the 2 training sessions
consent.p1e=Each of the assessments and training sessions will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.

consent.heading2=What will I be asked to do?
consent.p2a=Assessments
consent.p2b=You will be asked to complete questionnaires about your thoughts, mood, background, and personal mental health history.
consent.p2c=Training
consent.p2d=You will be presented with a training program designed to shift how you think about situations. You will be asked to read brief stories about situations that often produce anxiety and fill in missing letters to complete words.
consent.p2e=At the end of the study, you will receive more details about the study's rationale and design.

consent.heading3=Is there a payment for completing the study?
consent.p3=After completing the study (i.e., finishing two training sessions and two sets of questionnaires), you will receive a $20 electronic gift card. The gift card will be sent via email within 2 business days of being awarded. The cards are submitted through Tango Card, an e-gift cards service through which you can choose from top name-brands like Amazon, Starbucks, iTunes, Target, and many more options; or you can donate the value to a charity.

consent.heading4=Are there any benefits or risks to participating?
consent.p4a=For some people, completing the training program may help reduce symptoms of anxiety. However, there may be no direct benefits to you. For some people, being asked to answer questions about their thoughts and mood can be temporarily distressing, but most people experience minimal-to-no distress or do not feel distressed for long.
consent.p4b=Please note that MindTrails does not provide specific diagnostic or medical advice on our website, and we are limited in how we can respond to your personal requests.
consent.p4c=MindTrails is not able to offer financial compensation or to absorb the costs of treatment should you feel you have been injured as a result of participating in the MindTrails research study

consent.heading5=Can I stop at any time?
consent.p5a=While we hope that you will complete the entire study,
consent.p5b=participation in this study is voluntary
consent.p5c=, and you may end your individual session participation at any time by closing the study window. Further, your participation in this study is not at all related to your standing with other ongoing therapy or employers.
consent.p5d=Contact the team if you have any questions about the study or wish to be removed from the study.

consent.heading6=What is the MindTrails Privacy Policy?
consent.p6a=MindTrails uses the same secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) that banks and other commercial websites use to transfer credit card information in an encrypted format. This provides strong security for data transfer to and from our website, though privacy is necessarily limited by the security of the technology and wifi that is being used. Please note that completing the study in a public place where others might view your screen, and use of open networks or free Wi-Fi can increase the chance for loss of privacy.
consent.p6b=Please note that completing the study in a public place where others might view your screen, and use of open networks or free Wi-Fi can increase the chance for loss of privacy.
consent.p6c=To view the entire privacy policy in a separate page, please click

consent.p6e=MindTrails uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. MindTrails uses this service to track device usage, navigation patterns, and referrals.

The information that Google collects is anonymous in nature, and will not be personally identifiable. By participating in the MindTrails study, you consent to this information being collected by Google Analytics.
consent.p6f=Data Sharing
consent.p6g=We wish to share de-identified data from this protocol online. Many funding agencies and journal outlets encourage researchers to make data available to other researchers online. This is becoming a common practice in research endeavors around the world and data sharing helps ensure that best practices in data analysis are being upheld. The publication of data online involves preparing a data file for other researchers that removes any personally identifying data from participants before making it available over the Internet. Participants' names and other personally identifying information in this protocol will never be published online. Importantly, open data sharing practices pose no threat to participants, as participants' names and identifying information are never connected to the data they provide.

# Debriefing

debriefing.title=Debriefing
debriefing.name=MindTrails Spanish Language Version
debriefing.print=Print

debriefing.p1a=We are studying new approaches to reduce anxiety. The approach used in the study is based on models of anxiety, which have shown that anxious people tend to interpret ambiguous situations as threatening. It has been proposed that the tendency to interpret things in a threatening way plays a role in the onset of, and recovery from, anxiety problems. Thus, during training, you were asked to read and imagine yourself in a series of brief stories and the last word (or word fragment) gave almost all of the brief stories a positive meaning. We expect this will encourage a more flexible and less negative thinking style.
debriefing.p1b=In the current study, we are evaluating a new version of our program that is specifically designed to meet the needs of individuals experiencing anxiety who identify as Hispanic. We are offering the program in its original English form and also in a new Spanish form, and we are inviting some people to complete the program who describe themselves as fluent in both English and Spanish, and other people who describe themselves as fluent in Spanish but not in English. We are also testing whether different messages inviting people to participate in the program are more or less effective at encouraging people to enroll. For instance, some people received an invitation to participate that emphasized how the program might help relieve physical symptoms of anxiety while other people received an invitation to participate that emphasized how the program might help them enjoy more time with their family.
debriefing.p1c=If you are interested in learning more about modifying thinking patterns, see the following websites:
