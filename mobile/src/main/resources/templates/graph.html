        <h1>Graph of Progress</h1>
        <p>You completed a questionnaire after each session about how your anxiety had been since your
            last session. This allowed us to track your progress over the course of the MindTrails program.</p>
        <p>The graph below shows the changes in your score on the anxiety questionnaire, which is called the
            Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale. On this scale, the higher the score, the
            more difficulties with anxiety you reported at that point in time.</p>
        <p>The orange line shows your specific scores on each day. The blue line shows your overall change pattern,
            taking into account the variation that occurred across sessions.</p>
        <div class="longSection">
            <div id="graph"/>
        </div>
        <p th:if="${status == 'lot'}">
            Your change in scores suggests that you improved a lot over the course of the study. Congratulations on
            making such great progress!
        </p>

        <p th:if="${status == 'little'}">
            Your change in scores suggests that you experienced some improvement over the course of the
            study, but may still have some remaining anxiety symptoms. Congratulations on the progress that
            you have made thus far, and we encourage you to keep working on managing your anxiety to
            experience further improvement!
        </p>

        <p th:if="${status == 'same'}">
            Your change in scores suggests that your anxiety did not change a lot over the course of the
            study. This could have occurred for many reasons – e.g., the program is not a great match for
            your needs, or you were not in a study group that was expected to be the most effective (see
            below), or this may be an unusually difficult or stressful time for you, etc. We are sorry that the
            program was not more helpful for you and that you are still experiencing significant anxiety
            symptoms. We strongly encourage you to keep working on managing your anxiety because there
            are many different treatment options that can be helpful, and we hope you will find a program
            that is a good match for you.</p>

        <p th:if="${status == 'worse'}">
            Your change in scores suggests that your anxiety became somewhat worse over the course of the
            study. This could have occurred for many reasons – e.g., the program is not a great match for
            your needs, or you were not in a study group that was expected to be the most effective (see
            below), or this may be an unusually difficult or stressful time for you, etc. We are sorry that the
            program was not more helpful for you and that you are still experiencing significant anxiety
            symptoms. We strongly encourage you to keep working on managing your anxiety because there
            are many different treatment options that can be helpful, and we hope you will find a program
            that is a good match for you.

        <p> When reviewing this graph, we'd like to let you
            know that you were in an active training group (rather than a control group, which we did not expect to
            be as effective). However, if you’re not happy with your progress and/or wish to seek further care for
            your anxiety difficulties, we strongly encourage you to review the Mental Health Resources page, which
            can help you find other independent (e.g., books, computer, or mobile app) or therapist-guided treatment
            options.</p>
