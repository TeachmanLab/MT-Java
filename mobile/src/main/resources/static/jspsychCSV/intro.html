    <p>In this part of the assessment, you will read a series of very
        short stories.  Pay attention to the title of each story because
        after you have read all the stories, you will be asked more
        questions about them.</p>
    <h3>For each story:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Read each sentence carefully and <i>really imagine</i>
            yourself in the situation described.
        </li>
        <li>Even if the story describes you reacting in a way
            that you would not usually react, please try to
            picture yourself responding in the way the story
            describes.
        </li>
        <li>There will be an incomplete word at the end of
            each paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>Press the key on the keyboard that
            complete the word.
        </li>
        <li>When you correctly complete the word you
            will move on to the next screen and be asked a
            question about the story.
        </li>
    </ul>
